In my research, I like to explore the many aspects of programming languages. I&#39;m particularly interested in type systems and theory, the semantics and implementation of domain-specific languages, as well as formal methods for scientific modeling. Until recently, I spent my time pondering the type safety of Scala and related type systems. These days, Iâ€™m busy applying formal methods and type theory to problems in privacy and security, and hacking type soundness proofs in Agda. I&#39;m interested in the design of domain-specific languages for modeling probabilistic and stochastic systems, especially biochemical systems. I have also written a GNU/Emacs mode for Kappa, a modeling language for systems biology.

My own sphere of special interest in the field of Computer Science is comprised by the challenge of supporting the development of high-quality, correct-by-construction software and systems, featuring predictability, adaptivity, efficiency, re-usability, maintainability and modularity that are key issues in contemporary information systems (such as embedded systems or service oriented architectures).

My research interests range from computer security to applied cryptography. Over the last years I have worked on a number of areas in these fields, including: Attack modeling or Security on RFID systems.
